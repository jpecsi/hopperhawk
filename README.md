# HopperHawk

*HopperHawk is an ESPHome-based smart monitoring device designed for pellet smoker enthusiasts. Using a TOF10120 time-of-flight sensor, it continuously measures the pellet level in your smoker's hopper and reports real-time fill status directly to Home Assistant. For additional information, [check out the wiki!](https://github.com/jpecsi/hopperhawk/wiki). Interested? You can buy a HopperHawk device from [my Tindie store](https://www.tindie.com/products/sidelinedata/hopperhawk/)!*
